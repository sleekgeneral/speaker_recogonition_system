# speaker_recogonition_system
This is a MATLAB-based speaker recognition system designed for both identification and verification of speakers using audio recordings. The project utilizes digital signal processing and statistical modeling techniques to analyze and classify human voices.

Features
Speaker Identification: Determines the identity of a speaker from a predefined database.

Speaker Verification: Confirms whether the claimed identity of a speaker is true.

Feature Extraction: Employs Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).

Speaker Modeling: Utilizes Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for classification.

User Interface: Basic GUI for ease of testing and demonstration.

Technologies Used
MATLAB (R202x or newer recommended)

Signal Processing Toolbox

Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

How It Works
Audio samples are processed to extract MFCC features.

Each speaker's features are modeled using a GMM.

For recognition, the system compares new audio input against stored models and selects the most likely match.

For verification, it checks if the input matches a claimed speaker identity with a confidence threshold.

Evaluation
The system achieves good accuracy in quiet environments with consistent recording conditions. Performance may degrade in noisy or low-quality recordings.

Future Improvements
Integration with deep learning for improved robustness

Real-time audio processing

Noise reduction techniques

Web or mobile deployment options via MATLAB App Designer or MATLAB Compiler
